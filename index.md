# Overview

Manoa Rainbow Cards is a Trading Card Game (TCG) app where University of Hawai'i at Manoa professors are the cards! Developed by the team at Rainbow Cards.

This TCG application aims to increase familiarity and engagement between the students and professors of the UH Manoa campus. Each professor card comes with various contact information, projects/achievements and fun facts about them, which may also be traded between users of the app. This further fosters a sense of community on campus and helps students connect to their mentors better.
