## Overview

Manoa Rainbow Cards is a Trading Card Game (TCG) app where University of Hawai'i at Manoa professors are the cards! Developed by the team at Rainbow Cards.

This TCG application aims to increase familiarity and engagement between the students and professors of the UH Manoa campus. Each professor card comes with various contact information, projects/achievements and fun facts about them, which may also be traded between users of the app. This further fosters a sense of community on campus and helps students connect to their mentors better.

The Manoa Rainbow Cards project implements the following technologies and resources:
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Project Features

Manoa Rainbow Cards is planned to have features such as:
* Viewable user profiles, which displays their cards with a degree of customizability
* Search function to find other users' profiles
* Catalog of all professor cards to see all cards that a user owns and doesn't own
* Ability for professors to register on the app and edit their own cards
